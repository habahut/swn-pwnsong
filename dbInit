There are also bays for small ships within the station itself.' );
INSERT INTO planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Euralt', 1, NULL, 'Planet was a very important and prosperous planet before the war. Originally settled for mining operations and to explore alien ruins, the planet has a veritable soup of poisonous microbes and gasses in the atmosphere. Propserous mining pre-scream led to larger and larger settlements, until the first bubble cities were created. At the time of the civil war, Euralt was one of the most prosperous planets in the sector, its many cities linked by public transit and underground tunnels. These bubbles are several feet thick of transparent metal alloy, knowledge of manufacturing this was lost during the scream. These cities were shattered during the war, though it took significant orbital bombardment to pierce the bubble shield. But once it was cracked, there was no hope for occupants. The microbes in the planets atmosphere lead to massive mutation similar to radiation posoining and essentialy tear apart the infected within several hours to a day. With the exception of Genova all the cities on Euralt were cracked and reduced to graveyards. The atmosphere is biologically dangerous, but not particularly corrosive or elementally hazardass. Thus a standard vacc suit can last until its air supply runs out. But the smallest penetration in the suit is almost guarenteed to be fatal.');
INSERT INTO planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Fenris', 1, NULL, 'Has a wildly fluctuating temperature, from freezing to above 100F and is constantly wracked by storms.
Little is known about Fenris besides ancient legends. Legend has it that a powerfully psychic, but technologically primitive Alien race originally inhabited this planet. Known as the Walkers, they had 4 legs with an upright humanoid torso. Humans lived side by side with these creatures for centuries, and history claims the first psychic university was built on this planet. The inhabitants enjoyed a technologically advanced, psychic utopia, until the Scream. The Walkers were all but anihilated by the Scream, with the few that left driven irrivocably insane. The psychic power unleashed by their species descent into destruction and madness ripped apart the cold atmopshere, and the planet is now covered in massive storms. It is rumored that some Walkers still live, wandering mindlessly across the surface.
Landing on the planet is dangerous, only in that there is often low visibility, and flying into a mountain would be bad for the ship. Once landed, the storms are generally not strong enough to much damage to a ship capable of using a spike drive.');

INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Vel Nostra', 2, NULL, 'The breadbasket of the sector, Vel Nostra has excellently fertile land covering most of its land mass. Vel Nostra has a pangea continental setup, with one major city, Vel Nossum in the center. The rest of the world is covered in plantations and farmlands, with minor towns and small cities here and there. The entire planet is mostly in the hands of the Kassir Syndicate, though none will talk about it. The inhabitants of Vel Nossum live very well, on the backs of the poor folks harvesting the various agricultural products across the continent. With such a massive ocean, the majority of the inhabitants eat the varied sea life almost exclusively, with a near constant parade of cargo ships shuttling food to Columbo. Nearly every type of crop is produced here, from tobacco varients and other luxury items to essentials like tofu and corn.');
INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'New Mercury', 2, NULL, 'A major industrial hub, this planets atmosphere is hot enough to melt metal on the side facing the sun. Rivers of molten lead and iron cover the surface facing the sun, bringing their fiery cargo to the side in shadow, only to be brought back as the planet spins. Because of its extreme heat and proximity to the sun, it is dangerous for non-specially designed ships to approach. The human habitat is buried deep underground, and entrance is only possible for a few hours per day when the entrance is maximally rotated from the sun. The human population on this planet is minimal, only the bare minimum of humans required to maintain the automated mining equipment. The value of this planet is unimaginable, however, as due to the extreme heat and pressure underground rare and valuable minerals abound. Ostenisbly controlled by Tycho Enterprise, this station is actually fairly independant. The hydroponics allow a meager, but survivable existence if cut off from outside aid. And due to the geography of the planet a conventional siege is almost impossible. An uneasy truce between Tycho Enterprise and the inhabitants of New Mercury exists, where New Mercury provides a tiny discount to Tycho Enterprise, and in return Tycho protects them from overt harassment and sabotage.');
INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Columbo', 2, NULL, 'Probably the most populated planet. Nearly a billion inhabitants across numerous cities and continents. Probably the closest world in the sector to the supposed original habitat of earth. This is also the most technologically advanced planet in the sector. As part of the truce, the Terran Republic and Transhumanist Cabal both moved their major political spheres to the same city, Sakina. As such, it is a city of extremes, where the most conservative folks walk next to people covered in body modification. Lots of preachers yelling in public, and often getting into fights. Constant skirmishes between quote-unquote independant factions. Corporate espionage, spy culture. Rumors abound of secret militias and weapons stores by the various factions entrenched here. Home to the famed Animus-Vox psychic university, as well as major industrial zones. Has an ansible. Heavily imports and relies on food from Vel Nostra.');

INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Chimera', 3, NULL, 'One of the few pieces of history still preserved, The Intergalactic Hunt, took place here. A sort of Hunger Games / Reality Show, where intrepid adventurers from across the known universe would hunt the genetically modified game animals on this planet. Each team would have a camera crew and film their time on the planet, beamed directly to satellites, and to the Sister Planet, Colosseum. From there it would be sent out to the rest of the galaxy. Was a hunters paradise before the scream. An entire planet of genetically modified game animals ranging from living clay pidgeons all the way up to truly dangerous dinosaur hybrids. After the scream the human prescense on this planet was wiped out. Who knows what beasts the rapid evolution set loose on this planet has given rise to.There are rumors of military training grounds as well as secret laboratories still left on the planet, as well as treasures left behind by former occupants.');
INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Colosseum', 3, NULL, 'Once the proud host of the Intergalactic Hunt, a universe wide competition of adventurers and hunters on Chimera, this planet is now largely abandoned. The towering stadium seating viewing buildings have mostly been reclaimed by nature, and most major cities barely a shell of their former glory. Still, with a temperate climate and breathable atmosphere, the human population never truly dissappeared. There is one major city Trealt, which was once a thriving metropolis with an Ansible. It has now reduced its size greatly to much smaller portion of the city, with wooden walls around its outskirts. They have a strong fear and distrust of foreigners (would probably be freaked out by any tatoos on the party, since the nomadic tribes are known to try and sneak into the city and kidnap people for slave labor or food. The city is a pretty standard city otherwise, population in the high tens of thousands. Because of the fear of infiltrating tribesmen, the police presence is very high, as well as a very well funded NSA type organization, originally intended to flush out dangerous terrorists, has matured into a more orwellian type of society. Some of the tribes traveling the world are quite savage. Some are canabilistic.');

This station has seen better days. The core docks, refueling and repair station is still operational, kept afloat by an unsteady flow of travelers between systems. The rest of this station has fallen into disrepair and is officially unoccupied. However, the quote-unquote government controlling Tamara Station is notably corrupt and disinterested in keeping order. The official visitor list is usually smaller than the number of ships actually parked on the station by a factor of at least 2. Its an open secret that the Roskat gang uses this as their home base.');

INSERT INTO Planets (name, systemId, imgUrl, description) VALUES ( 'Ithyana', 4, NULL, 'Ice world, with a tiny wet region on the equator capable of growing crops. Most famous for the Vinyala wool, harvested from the Vinyalas, furry kitten looking creatures that inhabit the icy regions north of the south pole The south pole faces the sun and is warm enough to melt the ice, and is the only portion of the planet that has breathable atmosphere. Massive cliffs of ice to either the north and south contain the atmosphere in this canyon. Above the ice on this planet is near vaccuum. Through the ice run tunnels of varying size. The locals claim that once the monstrous Wraiths roamed the whole world, carving out the tunnels through the ice. The wraiths are Monstrous gorilla / bear combination beasts, the largest killed was 5 tons and almost 15 feet tall. It took on a squad of marines in power armor and ripped straight through a few before finally going down. The locals have legends that the further north you travel the more monstrous these beasts become, growing as large as starships at the poles. The locals claim to have a tradition of traveling to the north pole once in your life, but no expeditions have ever returned from further north than a hundred miles.');

Previously a collection of sometimes friends, sometimes enemies city states looking to control the limited mining operations of precious materials, a nuclear war broke out in one of their many skirmishes, almost 200 years ago. Some say it was sabotage, whatever the case the planet was left uninhabitable. The fall out should start clearing up soon, and with an expected gold rush as salvagers and adventurers rush to claim the remnants on the planet.');

Prescream this was a bustling world. The planets surface is constantly undergoing earthquakes, but a floating city drifts amongst the upper atmosphere, using some unknown prescream technology. Whatever was happening on this planet pre scream is not happening now, and whatever reason there was to build a floating city on this planet has been lost to time. So has the sanity of its remaining inhabitants. With no access to natural resources on the planets surface, the populace and culture stagnated, while the people have inbred and mutated into something more. The populace worships the floating statues in the city with a cultish zeal. Several abandoned space ships are docked on the surface, the fate of its crew forever forgotten.');

Gasoline is used by the warlords to wage constant war on each other, while the spike drive fuel is sold travelers. The warlords compete with each other to sell the spike fuel, since its essentially free to them. They have some crazy idea that they are making a name for themselves by impressing the travelers, so they go to great lengths to do so. The people are poor and powerless.');
